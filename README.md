### Techinical Background

In terms of technical coding skill I've recieved 99% of my abilities from GVSU's courses. CIS courses 162/163 specifically made me skilled in my primary language of Java and other courses have given me hints of C and Python however I do not feel as comfortable in those languages as I do Java. Other than that I don't have much. I did a bit of HTML in high school and what I remember is almost worthless. But when it comes to Java I feel comfortable in my ability to program working code.
